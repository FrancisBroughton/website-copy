        <h1>A virtual power plant</h1>
        <p class="bold-para">GridBeyond acts as an intermediary between the Grid Operators and large energy users.</p>
        <p>Using our unique technology platform, we are able to create a ‘virtual power plant’ 
          where the energy-using assets of hundreds of companies are aggregated. 
          This provides a grid-balancing mechanism that helps the system operators to 
          deliver on their vision for a more sustainable, flexible power infrastructure. </p>

        <p>They offer companies that participate in grid balancing schemes the potential to 
          earn extra income from assets by adjusting power consumption in real-time. </p>

        <p class="bold-para">GridbeyondTM, formerly Endeco Technologies, unlocks powerful, long-term, recurring revenue streams from Grid Operators for significant industrial and commercial energy users.</p>
        <p>We achieve this by enabling companies across a range of sectors to participate in 
            demand side response schemes. These grid-balancing mechanisms deliver generous 
            financial incentives in return for changes in the way businesses use electricity. 
            This contributes to a more sustainable, balanced energy system.
