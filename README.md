# website-copy

I built the html both the HTML and CSS in dry code. in the HTML I used class names that are relevent to the block of code it represents. It also meant that when formatted in CSS i could target a larger group of components. All the HTML code is sat within a container so that it is easier to formatt the padding.


In the CSS I use variables for colours and typography so that they end up scattered throughout the code.. It becomes an easier exercise if there was ever any changes required by having requirements that are constants in one place.
